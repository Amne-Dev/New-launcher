        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 16, 2026</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>New Launcher ("we", "our", "the Project") provides a lightweight, open-source Minecraft launcher. We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal user data from the launcher to any central servers. This Privacy Policy explains what (if any) data may exist locally on your machine, how the launcher interacts with third-party services you choose to use, and the privacy choices you have.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. What We Do NOT Do</h2>
            <p>To be explicit: the launcher does not collect, aggregate, or transmit personal user data to the project maintainers or any central server. There is no background telemetry sent to us. Any logs, profiles, or configuration files remain on your local machine unless you explicitly choose to share them (for example, by uploading a bug report to GitHub).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. What May Exist Locally</h2>
            <p>The launcher stores certain information locally on your computer to function correctly. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Profiles & Account Tokens (local only):</strong> If you add an account (Ely.by or other), the launcher keeps the minimal data required to use that account (display name, UUID, and any local token) in your local configuration directory so you can launch the game. This data is not sent to the project maintainers.</li>
                <li><strong>User-provided content:</strong> Skins, chosen usernames, and files you select are stored locally when used by the launcher.</li>
                <li><strong>Optional logs you choose to save:</strong> Crash logs or debug output remain on your machine. If you choose to paste or upload them to GitHub or a support channel, you are explicitly sharing them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. How the Launcher Operates</h2>
            <p>The launcher is designed to run on your device and only use data stored locally or data you explicitly request. Key points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The launcher does not phone home. There is no automatic upload of profiles, logs, or usage data to the maintainers' servers.</li>
                <li>When you request remote resources (for example, fetching skins from Ely.by or checking GitHub releases), those HTTP requests are made directly from your machine to the third-party service.</li>
                <li>If you opt into any future telemetry or error-reporting features, those will be clearly labeled and require your explicit consent before any data is transmitted.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Local Storage & Configuration</h2>
            <p>The launcher stores configuration and cache locally on your computer (in the launcher config directory). This includes profiles, selected skins, installation metadata, and any locally-downloaded assets. We do not transmit your local configuration to our servers by default.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The launcher may interact with third-party services you choose to use (e.g., GitHub for updates, Ely.by for skins). These interactions are direct between your client and the third party; the project does not act as an intermediary. Please review those services' privacy policies for details on how they handle data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Telemetry & Analytics</h2>
            <p>The default launcher does not send telemetry or analytics to central servers. We will never add hidden telemetry. Any future optional reporting features will be opt-in and described in the release notes and on this page.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
            <p>The web pages in this repository (the site) may use standard browser cookies for session and preferences if hosted as a web site. The launcher application itself does not use browser cookies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We follow reasonable practices to protect data stored locally by the launcher. Because the launcher runs on your device, you are responsible for securing access to your machine and launcher config files.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The launcher is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Changes to this Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will change the "Last Updated" date on this page. Significant changes will be noted in the changelog or release notes. If any change introduces data collection (which is not planned), it will be documented and require explicit opt-in.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. Contact</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about this policy or privacy concerns, please open an issue on the project's GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Amne-Dev/New-launcher/issues" target="_blank">Project Issues</a>.</p>
